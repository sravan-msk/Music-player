<h4>I recently built a music player application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My main focus was to design something simple, clean, and responsive so that it works well on any device.<h/h4>
<br><br>
<b>The player comes with all the essential features you’d expect:</b>
  <ul>
<li>You can play or pause music easily.</li>
<li>Navigate between tracks using next and previous buttons.</li>
<li>A seekbar shows the song’s progress and updates in real-time as the music plays.</li>
<li>It also displays the current playback time along with the total song duration, making it easy to keep track.</li>
</ul>
